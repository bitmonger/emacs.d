* My emacs.d configuration

As my editor of choice I run Emacs. One of the benefits of Emacs is
that it'll install basically anywhere.

This configuration is designed to run in shells as well as on
desktops. There are some platform specific optimisations as well.

** Where is it?

It's built using [[http://orgmode.org][Org mode]]'s [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-source-code.html#Extracting-source-code][tangling functionality]].

My entire Emacs configuration is thus written in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] style,
and can be seen [[emacs.org][in this repo as =emacs.org=]].

** Old version

   The previous version can be found at [[https://www.github.com/bradleywright/emacs-d][bradleywright/emacs-d]]. This
   version has been refactored to use traditional Emacs loading
   techniques and macros for installing packages.

** Installing

Just check it out straight to the right directory, and use Make to
install it:

: cd ~/Projects/emacs.d && make

** Platform specific configuration

*** OS X desktop (Emacs.app)

- Left =option= key is remapped to =M-=
- =M-3= prints a literal =#= (UK Mac keyboards being weird)
- We use the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs][Solarized Dark]] theme
- Font is [[http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html][Inconsolata]]

*** OS X CLI in iTerm2

- When the [[https://github.com/altercation/solarized/blob/master/iterm2-colors-solarized/Solarized%20Dark.itermcolors][Solarized Dark iTerm2 theme]] is installed, we use the
  =solarized-dark= color theme
- Cut/paste are made to write/read from the clipboard (via =pbcopy=
  and =pbpaste=)
- Mouse highlighting works via xTerm capabilities

**** Required iTerm 2 Configuration

     - Re-map left =option= key to =+Esc=
     - Untick =Smart cursor color=

** Included libraries

The following libraries are included in non-attributable ways, i.e not
via package install or via a Git submodule:

- [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][Emacs Starter Kit]] was a very big early influence, and continues to
  be helpful.
